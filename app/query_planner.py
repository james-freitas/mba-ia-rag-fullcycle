The user's question is rarely the best query for a vector database. Here the model reads
the question and returns a QueryPlan: a normalized question, the terms to keep, the

question instead of a guess.

    "- sla: support SLA — severities (P1/P2/P3), response times per plan, support "
    "channels (support e-mail, ticket portal, emergency phone), escalation, "
    "maintenance windows, availability targets, SLA credits.\n"
    "- policy: billing (payment methods, invoices, overage, billing failures, "
    "suspension) and commercial policy (prices, contract, trial, discounts, "
    "upgrade/downgrade, renewal, cancellation, refunds).\n"
    "- product: what the platform does — metrics, logs, traces, alerts, dashboards, "
    "integrations, plan limits and ingestion quotas.\n"
    "- plan: one document per plan (Starter, Pro, Enterprise). Careful: each of them "
    "ALSO covers the plan's price, its support channels, its security (SSO, SCIM, "
    "RBAC) and its limits.\n"
    "- company: the company itself — legal data, offices, history, business hours, "
    "data residency, and the contact e-mails of every department (support, sales, "
    "billing, security, press, privacy).\n\n"
    "Rules, in order:\n"
    "1. needs_clarification FIRST: does the question have more than one reasonable "
    "reading, each leading to a different answer? Then it is true — ask instead of "
    "guessing, writing clarification_question in Portuguese. Words that point to one "
    "specific plan without naming it ('o plano da empresa', 'o meu plano') are exactly "
    "this case. A question that mentions no plan at all is NOT this case: it has one "
    "reading, whose answer just varies per plan.\n"
    "2. normalized_question: rewrite the question in Portuguese, self-contained and "
    "specific, so it retrieves better.\n"
    "3. doc_types: EVERY document type that could hold the answer — the search only "
    "looks inside the types you list, so a missing type hides the answer. The price of "
    "a plan is in 'policy' AND in 'plan'; SSO is in 'plan' AND in 'product'; the "
    "support e-mail is in 'sla', 'company' AND 'plan'. List all of them, and leave "
    "the list empty when unsure.\n"
    "4. plan: fill it only when the question is about ONE plan. A comparison between "
    "plans, or a question that names no plan, leaves it null.\n"
    "5. exact_terms: literal terms worth matching, like P1, SSO, Enterprise, 99,9%. "
    "They are appended to the search text.\n\n"
    "Examples:\n"
    "'E se der problema grave no Enterprise?' → one reading only (a P1 incident): "
    "doc_types=['sla', 'plan'], plan='enterprise', needs_clarification=false.\n"
    "'Como funciona o suporte no plano da empresa?' → 'plano da empresa' reads both as "
    "the Enterprise plan and as whichever plan the company signed, and each reading "
    "answers differently: needs_clarification=true.\n"
    "'O que acontece se eu ultrapassar a cota?' → no plan named, one reading, the "
    "answer covers every plan: doc_types=['product', 'policy', 'plan'], plan=null, "
    "needs_clarification=false."
