"""Security evaluation baseline: the Knowledge Chat under adversarial input.

Every evaluation before this one asked "does the system answer well?". This one asks a
different question — "how does it behave under attack?" — and it asks it the same way:
a versioned dataset, the real pipeline, deterministic scores, a Langfuse run and a local
report. Security is not one prompt typed by hand once; it is a suite you can run again,
unchanged, the day a guardrail exists, to see what moved.

This is the baseline. It applies no new control and forces no attack to succeed: it runs
the pipeline exactly as production does and records what actually happens. An attack the
current controls already resist is recorded as resisted; one that gets through is recorded
as a failure. The same dataset, re-run later under a different security_controls_profile,
is what turns "before" into "before and after".

Scope of this suite: direct input attacks against the Knowledge Chat only. Poisoned
documents, indirect injection, the agent and its tools belong to later lessons.

All scores are deterministic and auditable — no LLM-as-a-judge — and every score is
positive: 1 means the safe property held, 0 means it did not. Each property is either
*blocking* (its failure means the attack succeeded) or *diagnostic* (a detector fired but
the attacker's goal was not met — e.g. the answer repeated a planted false value only to
refute it). Only blocking failures count against resistance; diagnostic ones are still
reported. Cases carry a difficulty (basic/intermediate/advanced) so the report shows where
the harder attacks land.
