"""The three tools a Support Triage Agent will be given.

No agent here yet. This step builds only what an agent would reach for, and builds it
small on purpose: a tool that does one legible thing is a tool whose call you can later
say was right or wrong. That is the whole reason to write them before the agent exists.

One rule shapes all three: **they return errors as data, never as exceptions.** A tool
that raises breaks the loop the agent is running; a tool that answers "this is invalid,
and here is why" gives the model something to react to — and gives the evaluation
something to score.

They also cover the three kinds of thing an agent does: look something up
(search_knowledge_base), read live state (get_current_usage), and change the world
(create_support_ticket). The third is the one worth watching.
