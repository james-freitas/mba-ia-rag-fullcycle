"""OpenTelemetry instrumentation for the pipeline, isolated in this module.

The application depends on OpenTelemetry only, never on a backend SDK: where the
traces land is a deployment decision (console while developing, any OTLP endpoint
— Langfuse, Phoenix, Datadog, ... — later) and not a code change.

Tracing is configured only when OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true. Without that setup
the OpenTelemetry API hands out non-recording spans, so every call here turns
into a no-op and the pipeline behaves exactly as before.

Only safe attributes are recorded: ids, counts, flags, filters and timings. The
question and the final answer travel apart from them, as debug events, and only
when development explicitly asks for it. The prompts, the context, the chunk
contents, the documents, the API key and the database URL never leave.
